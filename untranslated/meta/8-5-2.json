It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"global_indicators.8-5-2-title","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"8","target_name":"global_targets.8-5-title","target_id":"8.5","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","en":{"language":"en","national_indicator_available":"Unemployment rate","comparison_sdg":"The time series is compliant with the global metadata.","goal_meta_national_link_text":"Metadata on the presented time series","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","target_name":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","un_designated_tier":"<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/\" title=\"Click here for more information on the UN tier classification.\"  target=\"_blank\">Tier I</a>","un_custodian_agency":"International Labour Organization (ILO)","goal_meta_link_text":"Metadata on this indicator","goal_meta_2_link_text":null,"goal_meta_3_link_text":null,"source_organisation_1":"Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Logo destatis\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px\" /></a>","source_url_1":"https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=13231-0003&bypass=true&language=en","source_url_text_1":"Unemployment rate \u2013 GENESIS online 13231-0003","source_organisation_2":"Statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat)","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/eurostat.png\" alt=\"Logo eurostat\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px\" /></a>","source_url_2":"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfsa_urgan&lang=en","source_url_text_2":"Unemployment rates - Eurostat table [lfsa_urgan]","computation_units":"Percentage","copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2021","data_footnote":"2020 preliminary data.","graph_title":"Unemployment rate","national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n<span></span>"},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-23","national_data_updated_date":"2021-04-23","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-23: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/MoBosse/testData/commit/738f20afb6fa99c60db0c2664f113a689c785b11","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/MoBosse/testData/commit/738f20afb6fa99c60db0c2664f113a689c785b11","indicator":"8.5.2"}
